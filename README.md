# MMM-2Day-NOAA-Forecast

This is a module for [MagicMirrorÂ²](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/tree/develop) that uses the [NOAA National Weather Service API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) forecast to show a consecutive 4 12-hr forecast. Initially, I tried to use the [OpenWeather One Call 3.0 API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3), but it gives a pretty inaccurate forecast. A project called [MMM-NOAA](https://github.com/cowboysdude/MMM-NOAA) already exists, but it uses the [WeatherBit API](https://www.weatherbit.io/api/weather-forecast-api), not the NOAA API.

I just wanted a reliable forecast that doesn't change or go down, and I think the NOAA National Weather Service is the best because it doesn't require user registration nor APK key currently (although I think they're working on a change for that).

## Acknowledgement

This module originates from the code in [MMM-3Day-Forecast](https://github.com/nigel-daniels/MMM-3Day-Forecast). The code and CSS have changed a lot, but all the credit for the layout and skeleton goes to the project.
